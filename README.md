## Notes
Assignment 3 data can be acquired from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/syde522) due to training and test files being too large for GitHub's upload limit.

Final semester project compares various machine learning algorithms to classify heart arrythmia using data from [Physionet's MIT-BIH Dataset](https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/). The paper can be read [here](arrhythmia.pdf).
